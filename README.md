# Overview

To learn and practice Rust, I decided to go through some 2023 Advent of Code Puzzles. Included in this Repository are days 4 and 5.

The puzzles require loading a large data set from a file, and manupulating it to generate some large number as an output.

Due to the simple, but varied, nature of the puzzles, this repository can serve as a resource for simple functions and examples of Rust use for my future reference.
